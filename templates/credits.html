	<h1>Credits</h1>
	There are some people out there, who have been a tremendous help in making the site what it is today. While nearly all the code on the site is my own, there are plenty of others who equally deserve credit</p>
	<hr>
	
	<h2>Ardy</h2>
	For initial support on the site's design and item creation process. Without him you'd have had a very ugly item creation page.
	<hr>

	<h2>Eevee</h2>
	For making me realize that there are far better ways to make a website than PHP.
	<hr>

	<h2>The Team Fortress 2 Wiki</h2>
	For their continued dedication to ensuring accurate and useful data as well as the graphics for a lot of items. Without them there simply would not be a paint or styles feature on this site without their hard work.
	<hr>

	<h2>Cafe of Broken Dreams</h2>
	For their considerable input on site design, and continued support of the site. Without them <s>I'd be playing on much better servers with much better maps</s> the design wouldn't be what it is.
	<hr>

	<h2>The Something Awful Goons</h2>
	For their initial interest in the site and continued suggestions. Without them <s>I'd be playing on Cafe</s> there'd be a much uglier paint selection menu.
	<hr>

	<h2>TF2B</h2>
	For their excellent backpack site, along with the flat images of particles. Without them unusual items just wouldn't look the same.
	<hr>

	<h2>JoshuaC</h2>
	For his graphic design abilities. Without him we wouldn't have icons for pda/hat/misc/action slot tokens that get used all around the site. Buy a Watchtower stamp/filter for him!
	<hr>

	<h2>Niklas Von Hertzem</h2>
	For the lovely html2canvas library!
	<hr>

	<h2>Valve</h2>
	For making this game to begin with. Without them the site wouldn't exist.
	<hr>

	<h2>You</h2>
	For your <s>3500</s> <s>21,000</s> 209,000 plus submissions.
