(If you don\'t care about any of the changes, at least scroll down to the part about contests so you can try to win a hat)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter four months in development. Hopefully it was worth the wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\'s take a moment to go through what\'s been changed in each section of the site:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sitewide Changes</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst and foremost, you can now log in using your steam account. This is done through Valve via OpenID so I have no chance to steal your password. Signing in is in no way necessary to use the site as it was previously, you can still submit, view, and vote on items without logging in, but it does have benefits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy logging in with a steam account, when you submit items they will be affiliated with your account rather than anonymous and users can browse for just one user\'s submissions. This is a good way to get some credit for your submission rather than it just appearing on the site one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogging in also allows you to leave comments on items. When browsing the item list there may be a number after the \"View\" link, this is how many comments are on the item, now you can explain the <a href=\"view-3206\">clever</a> <a href=\"view-181\">reference</a> that those less fortunate wouldn\'t understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfiles also contain quick links to the user\'s steam profile and backpack. Now you can find out if that really great item name already exists in the actual game. Personally, there aren\'t enough nametags in the world to cover the number of items I\'ve submitted in the past. On your own profile page, you may also adjust the number of items displayed per page when browsing if 10 isn\'t your favorite number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Latest Items</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latest items page is still where you\'ll likely be spending most of your time when not submitting anything new. All the same information as before is there, but with the new addition of particles on hats being displayed behind them. It\'s so authentic you might get somebody asking to trade you for your <a href=\"view-2067\">unusual Hustler\'s Hallmark with flames</a>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe navigation system has also been made a bit friendlier, now more massive dropdown menu for jumping to a page, just click the # button and enter the page you wish to go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>View Items</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the page for individual (or set) items, just as before you\'ll see just the item and its rating. In addition to this you will also be able to view the item details and get specifics on all the individual fields. Now you can find out if that shotgun was meant for a pyro or an engineer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItems can also be reported in case they are duplicates or junk submissions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Search Items</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is honest to goodness a real thing! You should (god willing) be able to search for any items submitted to the site based on the class it was submitted under, slot of the item, base item that was named, the name, the description, the date it was added, and having a certain keyword (no support for searching multiple keywords at the moment)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Random Items</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is exactly the same now that I think about it. Wow! Consistency!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Awards</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder awards you\'ll find the most popular items on the site, but no more will endless cycle of those same old items continually getting upvotes because people see them on the top page, while hundreds of pages of content are hardly glanced at after it falls from the first few pages. Now in addition to the top items of all time there are also pages for the top items of the past 30 and past 90 days, keeping things a little bit more fresh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that\'s not the only award. Do you like refined metal? I bet you do! It\'s like money but pretend. Well, now there\'s a way to get free metal with your naming skills through themed Contests! You can read the <a href=\"rules\">specific rules</a> and try your luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly explained here, at the start of each month a theme will be announced, and users have 7 days to submit any items related to that theme while signed into their steam account. After submitting an item just put the theme as one of the keywords for the item and it will be eligible to win. At the end of the month, I\'ll take a look at the scores for those items, and the submitter of the winning item will receive the prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the time the prize will be a bit simpler, like a refined metal (though donations for prizes will gladly be accepted). However, as this is the very first contest and I have to get you people motivated we\'ll start off with something a bit more enticing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<h2>This month\'s contest theme is: <span style=\"color:#FFD700\">\"MUSIC\"</span></h2><br>\r\nSubmit any items or set while signed into your steam account with the keyword \"Music\" to be eligible to win the following at the end of the month:<br>\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><br>\r\n<img src=\"images/378.png\"><br>\r\n<span class=\"tf2\" style=\"color:#FFD700\">Team Captain</span><br>\r\n(store bought, will be uncraftable)<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo hopefully that gets some people interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Misc</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Misc section unsurprisingly contains random things that don\'t fit anywhere else. Currently there\'s a fake item generator tool so you can make a pretty little mockup of an item you have an idea for, a table of the raw data for items so you can tell at a glance what items can be submitted and in what rarities, etc, and the site credits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Create Items</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last but not least, the create items page, in a more linear and hopefully easier to use form. Choose a class, choose a slot (be wary of some odd slot placements like the spy\'s revolvers being secondary items), type in the name and description and get a preview of your submission. Then before submitting you can fine tune it with the usual features, rarity, paint, particles, and form. Every paintable item has an image now, so no matter what paint you want to use on an item, if you can paint it, it has an image for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, when your item is complete you can fill in some keywords to tag your item. This is optional (though not for contest entries), but can provide another way for users to find your item later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, if you have several items which are related to each other and are better all together rather than separate, you can choose to create an Item Set, with each of the items grouped together. These items show up as a single set on the browse page which is expanded on the view page. They can be a lot of fun to come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>That\'s All</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that\'s everything! As always I\'m interested in your opinions on the new site, any suggestions you have or bugs to report. If you want to get in touch with me, send me an <a href=\"mailto:doctordos@gmail.com?subject=tf2tags feedback\">e-mail</a>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!','2011-12-01 05:00:00'),(2,'Itsy Bitsy Update','Dr. Dos','id/dr_dos','Spy.jpg','Just a simple content update.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Added Itsy Bitsy Spyder<br>\r\n* Updated item rules to consider new possible strange items from crate series #33 and #34<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, there are over 100 items that have been submitted for this month\'s contest!

Throw in any relevant notes and put it on the list. Maybe your sweetheart will buy you that Camera Beard.

While every other site out there is making you roll your eyes or making their sites a horrible pain to use for a day so they can do a dumb joke I\'m being <s>extremely lazy</s> <i>professional</i> and not altering the look of the site. (Seriously though, you did nearly get a Cutie Mark Tags site for pony butt tattoos.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\'t know how many people were around for last year, but April 1st means special wacky items are available on the site for your naming and describing pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis year there are a total of <b>99</b> special limited time items available. And this time there are contests so it serves a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off let me say that these April Fool\'s Day items are in fact April Fool\'s <b>Week</b> items. They\'ll be around until April 8th, since they\'ll be useful for this month\'s contest, but I\'ll get to the contests in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese new items can be accessed by the now negative token with a lens flare. You can\'t miss it. The slot tokens will change to reflect the general theme of the items contained within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, for this week, the item submission verification process is a lot more lax. Any standard TF2 item can for the next 7 days be in any rarity (sans normal because the site doesn\'t have support for that any longer), and have any unusual particles. So if you want to make a vintage Mann Co. Supply Crate with ghosts, go nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus there\'s an actual new feature on the site, when you make a set now, at the bottom of the page after you\'ve confirmed the basic name/desc of the latest item to add to the set, all the previous items added to the set will be visible. Now when you\'re naming a dozen different noodles, you won\'t have to worry about missing one or duplicating another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSet editing is essentially done but not yet on the live site until I fix an issue with it and vote reseting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the contests.

This naturally takes time, and I\'ve always done my best to avoid updating the site and having the possibility of broken images being used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I\'ve been tweaking my system for getting these images from the wiki and have implemented placeholders! Just the original item image (shrunk due to standard painted hat processing) with the hex color code of the paint in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example, the Tribal Bones misc for the pyro doesn\'t have any painted images yet. It\'s actually kind of old and I have no idea why it doesn\'t.

They\'ll both feature automatically generated posts sharing high scoring items. They\'re selected randomly so there\'s no promise a popular item you submitted will show up. The critera to be eligible to show up however, is for the item to have more than 50 points and be submitted in the past 120 days. These submissions must also not be in sets. Authors will be credited.<br><br>And the big one, Misses are no more! Items can only be voted up, not down. My reasoning behind this comes from several things that were happening with downvotes.<br><br>- \"Downvote this item!\" submissions<br>- \"Why do people keep downvoting my items!\" submissions<br>- \"This person left a comment I didn\'t like so I\'m going to downvote all their submissions\"<br>- Submissions in violation of the rules with negative twenty five points that nobody bothered to actually report<br><br>So now if you see a submission and it doesn\'t make you laugh or you don\'t think it\'s clever or you don\'t like the anime it references, too bad! Keep scrolling. If it violates the rules, report it! (And if you begin reporting items you want to downvote expect a ban yourself!)<br><br>Then there\'s also one other big change to the backend of the site. Updates to the available items and rarities will now run automatically every night. Painted items with placeholder images are logged and attempted to be redownloaded nightly as well. Ideally this means that placeholders will automatically get filled in as they become available.<br><br>There will likely be some issues at first. Each night the update script will send me an email report with any issues that may require manual intervention (such as conflicts between the schema and the wiki like whether the Ubersaw gets accent marks or not).

TF2 as a game was expanding in new directions and I wanted to be a part of its community and create something that the playerbase could enjoy.<br><br>The site slowly grew throughout the years, and even managed to put a few dollars in my pocket, something that I was extremely fortunate to have, if nowhere near enough to actually rely on. However, as the site grew, so did its problems. Technical issues like constantly breaking scripts as the tf2 wiki restructured, learning how to deal with a database table with over a million votes without grinding the site to a halt, and the general incompetence that comes from the site being my first time working with PHP (for the original incarnation) and Python (for the current form). I\'ve certainly been<br>known for my reluctance to fix site problems, always wanting to move onto something else rather than<br>come back and deal with my own mistakes like the lack of any notifications for comments, or having to<br>acquire copies of things like unusual particles as they were added to the game.<br><br>The technical upkeep of the site has simply always been unfun, and while I have grown as a programmer in the years since, I always sort of just accepted that this site would always be a nightmare to work with, with hacks on top of hacks whenever things had to change.<br><br>But for as many mistakes I had made in code, they paled before the mistakes I made in my role as a community manager. In the earliest days, there were no rules, and I simply expected that item submissions that were just racial slurs would get downvoted into oblivion which obviously was not the case. In these times, there wasn\'t a community at all. Everything was anonymous, and there were no comments. I wanted there to be a community and set to adding the requisite Steam integration and commenting system. Now people could talk to each other, find out what was being submitted by somebody, and ideally meet some cool people.<br><br>I am at least glad that a lot of you have done this. You have an absolutely bizarre to an outsider wiki documenting all of it. You have a Discord. You have a Xyzzy deck. You have made friends and formed bonds on a website where you\'re limited to fewer characters than Twitter\'s original incarnation. There\'s a community here, but it is not the sort of community I had hoped for. There\'s way more hostility than I had expected, and a rather bizarre to me focus on your total points. I epxected it to be a fun little statistic, rather than this sacred thing where any downvotes become suspicious immediately.<br><br>I should have done a lot of things differently. There should have been a staff from day one. There should have been consistantly enforced rules, and punishments for breaking them. There shouldn\'t have been misses at any point. I should have created a way for the community to talk to each other without having to do so via a picture of a shotgun first. I should have deleted items that weren\'t \"here\'s a good name for a hat\" but rather \"hey who wants to play Xyzzy with me\". The focus of the site got diluted and the community took over its original purpose.<br><br>And it\'s not the first time I\'ve seen it happen. It happened to nearly all the forums I was a part of when I was in my teens, and I was definitely one of the people that helped make those communities that way. Where they become so insular and agressive to anybody from the outside. Where people aren\'t going to stick around because they don\'t feel welcome. I have seen communities collapse from this and I have seen open and approachable communities which thrive. This site was a good idea with terrible execution. When I finall realized just how much of a mess things were, I ran off the site.<br><br>I have done several projects since this site, both on my own and with others, and have done my best to not repeat the mistakes I have here. I feel guilty that the site has become what it has, and I feel guilty whenever I try to nudge it in a different direction. So many bans that were met with people clamoring for them to be removed.<br><br>For all the hacked up code, the site did get mostly automated, except for the community management which you can never really automate. It felt freeing to not have to be around, but something would always drag me back. A new bug would show up, but it would never be \"hey logins aren\'t working\", it would always be \"somebody set their name to a blank and starting downvoting everything\". There was a time when I could trust people to not go out of their way to make things miserable for everyone else, but now I just have to accept that every issue the site runs into is somebody who wants to ruin things. Submissions of screenshots of vote logs, \"missbombs\" that are somebody downvoting 10 items and upvoting 8, and it\'s just so miserable to be dragged back here over and over again for the same thing.<br><br>There weren\'t comment limits before. Votes went from just a number, to anonymous but recored, to just straight up openly published. People would get in touch with me because they were being harassed by other users via steam where I am powerless to do anything or than play with the touchy subject of \"should behavior outside of the site be bannable on the site\"? It\'s such a mess. I hate it. It was far too late to try and hide my Steam account, but on several occasions I\'d make it private so people would leave me alone. I\'d avoid the site for weeks at a time, and realized that it felt good. It felt very good to just walk away and not worry.<br><br>When I saw that I had mistakenly used outdated payment info when I renewed the domain, it finally hit me that I could be completely done with the site forever. It felt good once more, knowing that I would not come home to messages on Steam about whoever the latest person was to ruin things for everybody. But I can\'t in good faith just vanish the site without a trace, erase its entire history, and leave its users fractured and without any way to reach each other if they didn\'t already have one. So that\'s why I decided to give you some time.<br><br>On January 16th, 2019 the domain name will once again expire, and this time, there will be no return. tf2tags is shutting down for good.<br><br>The shutdown does not need to be a plug being pulled. It can go differently if there are people in the community who want to keep it alive. I have posted the awful (and I do mean awful) code for the site to  <a href=\"https://github.com/DrDos0016/tf2tags\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. The code also includes a copy of the database from a few days ago if that helps to work with it. I strongly suggest that any attempts to take over tf2tags be done by creating a new site rather than working with the existing code for reasons better detailed in the repository\'s readme.<br><br>Should an alternative site be created within this year, I will gladly provide a up to date database dump. I am also willing to transfer ownership of the tftags.com domain as well. Other than that, I do not wish to be contacted. It is up to you now.<br><br>Thank you for the fun times when the times were still fun.','2018-01-30 03:33:06');
